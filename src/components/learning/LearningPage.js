        <h1>Technical Analysis</h1>

        <p>Crypto traders have several tools to assess the cryptocurrency market. One of them is an approach known as <b>Technical Analysis</b>. 
          Using this method, traders can get a better understanding of the market sentiment and isolate significant trends in the market. This data can be used to make more educated predictions and wiser trades. So in summary:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Technical analysis</b> considers the <i>price history</i> to identify psychological trends of a coin (using price charts and trading volumes)</li>
          <li><b>Fundamental analysis</b>, as opposed to technical analysis, is more focused on establishing <i>if a coin is over or under valued</i>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To understand why technical analysis is useful, we first need to understand the fundamental economic theory that technical analysis is based on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The market considers everything in its pricing. All existing, prior, and upcoming details have already been integrated into current asset prices. With regards to Bitcoin and crypto, this would be comprised of multiple variables like current, past, and future demand, and any regulations that impact the crypto market. The existing price is a response to all the current details, which includes the expectations and knowledge of each coin traded in the market. Technicians interpret what the price is suggesting about market sentiment to make calculated wise predictions about future pricing.</li>
          <li>Prices movement aren’t random. Rather, they often follow trends, which may either be long or short-term. After a trend is formed by a coin, it’s probably going to follow that trend to oppose it. Technicians try to isolate and profit from trends using technical analysis.</li>
          <li>‘What’ (i.e. price/volume movements) is more important than ‘Why’ (i.e. fundamentals). Technical analysis is more focused on the price of a coin than each variable that produces a movement in its price. Although multiple aspects could have influenced the price of a coin to move in a specific direction, the fact that it did move is more important than why it moved</li>
          <li>History tends to get repeated. It is possible to predict market psychology. Traders sometimes react the same way when presented with similar stimuli.</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
          
        <h2>Trend lines</h2>
        <p>Trend lines, or the typical direction that a coin is moving towards, can be most beneficial for traders of crypto. That said, isolating these trends can be easier said than done. Crypto assets might be substantially volatile, and watching a Bitcoin or crypto price movement chart will probably reveal a selection of highs and lows that form a linear pattern. With that in mind, Technicians understand that they can overlook the volatility and find an upward trend upon seeing a series of higher highs, and vice versa – they can identify a downtrend when they see a series of lower lows.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are trends that move sideways, and in these cases, a coin doesn’t move significantly in either direction. Traders should be mindful that trends come in many forms, including intermediate, long and short term trend lines.</p>

        <h2>Resistance and support levels</h2>
        <p>As there are trend lines, there are also horizontal lines that express levels of support and resistance. By identifying the values of these levels, we can draw conclusions about the current supply and demand of the coin. At a support level, there seems to be a considerable amount of traders who are willing to buy the coin (a large demand), i.e., those traders believe that the currency is priced low at this level and therefore will seek to buy it at that price. Once the coin reaches close to that level, a “floor” of buyers is created. The large demand usually stops the decline and sometimes even changes the momentum to an upward trend. A level of resistance is exactly the opposite – an area where many sellers wait patiently with their orders, forming a large supply zone. Every time the coin approaches that “ceiling”, it encounters the supply stacks and goes back.</p>
        <p>There is often a situation in which trade-offs can be between support and resistance levels: gathering close to support lines and selling around the resistance level. This opportunity usually takes place when lateral movement is identified.</p>
        <p>So what happens during breakout of resistance or support level? There is high probability that this is an indicator which is strengthening the existing trend. Further reinforcement of the trend is obtained when the resistance level becomes support level, and being tested from above shortly after the breakout.</p>
        <p>Note: False breakouts occur when a breakout happens, but the trend doesn’t change. Hence, we must use some more indicators, such as trading volume, to identify the trend.</p>

        <h2>Moving averages</h2>
        <p>Another technical analysis tool for crypto currencies and technical analysis in general, in order to simplify trend recognition, is called moving averages. A moving average is based on the average price of the coin over a certain period of time. For example, a moving average of a given day will be calculated according to the price of the coin for each of the 20 trading days prior to that day. Connecting all moving averages forms a line.</p>
        <p>It is also important to recognize the exponential moving average (EMA), a moving average that gives more weight in its calculation to the price values of the last few days than the previous days. An example is the calculation coefficient of the last five trading days of EMA 15 days will be twice that of the previous ten days.</p>
        <p>In the following graph we can see a practical example: If a 10-day moving average crosses above a 30-day moving average it might tell us a positive trend is coming.</p>

        <h2>Trading Volume</h2>
        <p>Trading volume plays an important role in identifying trends. Significant trends are accompanied by a high trading volume, while weak trends are accompanied by a low trading volume. When a coin goes down it is advisable to check the volume which accompanied the decline. A long-term trend of healthy growth is accompanied by a high volume of increases and a low volume of declines. It is also important to see that volume is rising over time. If the volume is decreasing during increases, the upward trend is likely to come to an end, and vice versa during a down trend.</p>

        <h2>Final guidelines</h2>
        <p>Using technical analysis, traders can identify trends and market sentiment and they also have the ability to make wiser investment decisions. However, there are a number of key points to consider:</p>
        <p>Technical analysis is a practical method that weighs past prices of certain coins and their trading volume. When considering entering a trade, it is not recommended that you only rely on technical analysis. Especially in the field of crypto, a field that often generates news, there are fundamental factors that have a significant impact on the market (such as regulations, ETF certificates, mining hash, etc.). Technical analysis only ignores and can’t predict these factors, so the recommendation is to mix together the technical analysis and the fundamentals analysis to make wise investment decisions.</p>
        <p>An analyst who makes a decision to buy a particular coin due to fundamental reasons can get technical support or find a good technical entry point and thus strengthen the trade’s ROI.</p>

        <h1>Technical Analysis (Advanced)</h1>

        <h2>Elliott Wave Analysis</h2>
        <p>The Elliott Wave principle is a form of technical analysis that cryptocurrency traders use to analyze market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and low in prices and other collective factors.</p>
        <p>Elliott Wave traders believe that markets are affected by collective investor psychology, or crowd psychology, and that it moves between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences.</p>
        <p>It seems to be a discipline suited for cryptocurrency traders because, at this time, they are being solely driven by investor psychology since there are no true underlying fundamentals backing its price rise other than aggressive buying due to limited supply.</p>
        <p>The key to success when using Elliott Wave analysis is to get the wave count right. Traders who use this technique believe the market moves in waves and that price action is primarily driven by groups of five waves as follows:</p>
        <img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/p6_Elliot_waves.png" width="100%"></img>
        
        <h2>Fibonacci Levels</h2>
        <p>Fibonacci levels are an offshoot of Elliott Wave Analysis. Simply stated, it is a way to find possible support and resistance levels in a cryptocurrency market.</p>
        <p>For example, after making a high/low range, traders expect a market to retrace 38.2% to 61.8% of this range to set up the next potential buying or selling opportunity. Both are Fibonacci levels.</p>
        <p>Inversely, after making a bottom, for example, a trader will try to forecast the next rally by applying mathematics to the price action. Traders use Fibonacci level to estimate the trend length and trend’s corrections.</p>

        <h2>Stochastics and Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
        <p>Stochastics and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are known in the technical analysis field as oscillators because they move between a low of 0 and a high of 100. Some cryptocurrency traders use them to determine the strength of a trend or to predict tops and bottoms because of overbought and oversold conditions. As Bitcoin prices often trade in an overbought or oversold condition due to its high volatility, RSI indicator signals traders to enter or exit a certain position.</p>
        <p>They both work under the premise that prices should be closing near the highs of trading range during upswings and toward the lower end of a trading range during downswings.</p>
        <p>During a prolonged move down, the oscillators will near 0, indicating that a bottom may be near. During a prolonged move up, the oscillators will near 100, indicating that a top may be near. In the attached graph, Bitcoin is currently at 81.92 (RSI), meaning that Bitcoin is overbought and a correction is expected.</p>

        <h2>MACD or Moving Average Convergence/Divergence</h2>
        <p>The MACD is categorized as an indicator. It is comprised of two exponential moving averages that help measure momentum in a crypto currency.</p>
        <p>The MACD compares short-term momentum and long-term momentum in a crypto currency market to signal the current direction of momentum rather than the direction of the price.</p>
        <p>When the MACD is positive, it signals that the crypto currency’s momentum is upward. The opposite is true when the MACD is negative.</p>   
        <img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/p9_MACD.png" width="100%"></img>

        <h2>Final guidelines</h2>
        <p>When trading crypto currencies like Bitcoin using various technical analysis tools, it is important that you have a strong conviction in what you are trying to accomplish because each technique outlined in this article has its own characteristics.</p>
        <p>For example, if you are a trend trader and using a trend indicator tool, you may not want to cloud your analysis with an oscillator because it may be indicating that a market is overbought or oversold. In other words, learn the characteristics of each technical tool before applying them to an actual market. With the lack of fundamental, using technical analysis indicators in cryptocurrencies and, in particular, Bitcoin, is essential for every crypto trader.</p>
